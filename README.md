Promineo Tech's Week 10 assignment was to use HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a single page website that contains the following:

- A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
- A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when clicking on submit.

I made a responsive study app that allows you to add items to a to-do list (with start and end date) and delete them when the action is completed. This was my first time using DOM manipulation to add and delete items so it was really rewarding when I completed the project.
